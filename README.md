**A complex spaceborne optical ship dataset (CBSD)**

Automated ship detection plays an increasingly important role in maritime surveillance, monitoring, and traffic supervision. It can help to control illegal fishing and cargo transportation. A new Complex Background Ship Dataset (abbreviated as *CBSD*) is proposed here.  

After cropping and selecting, we have collected 1658 high-resolution satellite images including about 4826 ships. Some images from the collected dataset are shown in Fig.![CBSD]('RSSD.jpg')
